"This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.

I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can."

-George Bernard Shaw

"Thank you for putting all of this information into baby language for me. Just because I need baby language does not mean I need Baby Park. Stop picking Baby Park, it's been 3 years of you jokers picking Baby Park. I've HAD IT!!!" 

-Joe Bisciotti
